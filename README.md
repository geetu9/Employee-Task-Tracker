# Employee-Task-Tracker
A simple, responsive web app to manage and track employee tasks with features like add/edit/delete tasks, filter/search, and status updates. Data is saved locally in the browser for easy use without a backend.


Project Setup Instructions

1. First, clone the project from GitHub to your computer.
2. Since this is a frontend project, just open the `index.html` file in a browser to run it.
3. If you want, you can run a local server (like Python’s `http.server`) to avoid any browser restrictions.

 Frameworks and Libraries Used

1. I used plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build the app.
2. Google Fonts (Inter) for nicer text.
3. No other frameworks or libraries were used.
4. The app saves data locally in the browser using localStorage.

 Assumptions Made

1. The user has a modern browser that supports JavaScript.
2. No backend server is needed because all data is stored locally.
3. The app is meant for simple task tracking for small teams or personal use.
